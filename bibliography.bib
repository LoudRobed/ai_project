We present four evolutionary algorithms that derive from biological theories on the evolution of altruism in nature and compare them systematically in two experimental scenarios where altruistic cooperation can lead to a performance increment. We discuss the relative merits and drawbacks of the four methods and provide recommendations for the choice of the most suitable method for evolving altruistic robots.},

	abstract = {This article is concerned with a fixed-size population of autonomous agents facing unknown, possibly changing, environments. The motivation is to design an embodied evolutionary algorithm that can cope with the implicit fitness function hidden in the environment so as to provide adaptation in the long run at the level of population. The proposed algorithm, termed {mEDEA}, is shown to be both efficient in unknown environments and robust to abrupt and unpredicted changes in the environment. The emergence of consensus towards specific behavioural strategies is examined, with a particular focus on algorithmic stability. Finally, a real-world implementation of the algorithm is described with a population of 20 real-world e-puck robots.},

	abstract = {Grounds for thinking that the model described in the previous paper can be used to support general biological principles of social evolution are briefly discussed.

Two principles are presented, the first concerning the evolution of social behaviour in general and the second the evolution of social discrimination. Some tentative evidence is given.

More general application of the theory in biology is then discussed, particular attention being given to cases where the indicated interpretation differs from previous views and to cases which appear anomalous. A hypothesis is outlined concerning social evolution in the Hymenoptera; but the evidence that at present exists is found somewhat contrary on certain points. Other subjects considered include warning behaviour, the evolution of distasteful properties in insects, clones of cells and clones of zooids as contrasted with other types of colonies, the confinement of parental care to true offspring in birds and insects, fights, the behaviour of parasitoid insect larvae within a host, parental care in connection with monogyny and monandry and multi-ovulate ovaries in plants in connection with wind and insect pollination.},
